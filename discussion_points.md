## Important Design Choices and Trade-offs:

1. ### Caching:
    **Design Choice**:
   
    Caching weather data using Django's cache system helps reduce the load on the weather API and improves response times.

    To optimize the usage of the weather API and minimize API calls, the application employs a caching strategy that limits the retrieval of weather data for the same location (zip code) to at most every 2 hours. This means that once weather data for a specific location is fetched, it will be stored in the cache, and subsequent requests for the same location will retrieve the cached data until the 2-hour expiration period is reached.
   
    **Trade-offs**:
   
    Cached data may become stale if not updated frequently. You need to decide an appropriate cache expiration time.
    Increased memory usage due to cached data. Consider the trade-off between memory usage and performance.
   
3. ### Django Rest Framework (DRF):
    **Design Choice**:
   
    Using DRF for building APIs provides a powerful and flexible toolkit for developing web APIs in Django.
   
    **Trade-offs**:
   
    The flexibility of DRF comes with a learning curve. Developers need to be familiar with DRF concepts and practices.
    Overhead of additional layers compared to a minimalistic approach. Consider the trade-off between development speed and performance.


## Deployment to Production:
1. ### Database Setup:

    Set up a production-ready database like PostgreSQL.
    Configure database connection settings in the production environment.

2. ### Security:

    Ensure that sensitive information such as secret keys and database credentials are stored securely.
    Set up HTTPS for secure communication.

3. ### Django Settings:

    Adjust Django settings for production, including DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS, and other security-related settings.

4. ### Web Server and Application Server:

    Choose a production-ready web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to serve static files and handle requests.
    Use a production-ready application server (e.g., Gunicorn) to run the Django application.

## Scaling for 1000 Requests Per Second:

1. ### Load Balancing:
    Introduce load balancing to distribute incoming requests across multiple application server instances.

2. ### Database Scaling:
   Optimize database queries and consider database scaling options such as read replicas or sharding.
   
3. ### Caching Strategies:
    Optimize caching strategies to reduce the load on the database.
    Consider distributed caching solutions for improved scalability.
   
4. ### Asynchronous Processing:
   Use asynchronous processing for time-consuming tasks to free up application server resources.
   
5. ### Horizontal Scaling:
    Scale horizontally by adding more application server instances to handle increased traffic.
   
6. ### Content Delivery Network (CDN):
    Utilize a CDN for caching and serving static content to reduce the load on the application servers.
   
7. ### Monitoring and Optimization:
    Implement monitoring tools to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the application accordingly.
   
8. ### Auto-scaling:
    Consider implementing auto-scaling strategies to automatically adjust the number of application server instances based on traffic patterns.
